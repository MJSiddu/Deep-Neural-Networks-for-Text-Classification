# Deep Neural Networks For Text Classification:

- We have implemented our code in Jupyter Notebook in Python 3 which is named as ADBI_Capstone_Project.ipynb. 
- It is required to have the dataset file in the same folder as that of the jupyter notebook. 
- Our dataset file is a csv file and is named as News_Category_Dataset.csv
- We have 20 categories in the dataset. Follow below steps to run the notebook:
	- a. To open the jupyter notebook, Run: jupyter notebook <-- path to jupyter notebook -->
	- b. Our jupyter notebook - ADBI_Capstone_Project.ipynb
	- c. Run each cell in this jupyter notebook sequentially.
- We are saving the model weights in the following files as our model takes longer time to build.
- Below is the naming convention:
	- a. For CNN Model: cnnModel.txt
	- b. For RNN Model: rnnModel.txt
	- c. For HAN Model: hanModel.txt
- It is required to have the following libraries installed:
	- a. Keras
	- b. NLTK
	- c. Numpy 
	- d. Pandas
	- e. Sklearn
	- f. MatPlotLib
- Libraries can be installed using the below command
	pip install <library name>
