1. We have implemented our code in Jupyter Notebook in Python 3 which is named as ADBI_Capstone_Project.ipynb. 
2. It is required to have the dataset file in the same folder as that of the jupyter notebook. 
3. Our dataset file is a csv file and is named as News_Category_Dataset.csv
4. We have 20 categories in the dataset.
	a. To run the jupyter notebook, follow below commands:
	b. Open jupyter notebook: jupyter notebook <path to jupyter notebook>
5. Example: jupyter notebook ADBI_Capstone_Project.ipynb
	a. Run each cell in this jupyter notebook sequentially.
	b. We are saving the model weights in the following files as our model takes longer time to build.
6. Below is the naming convention:
	a. For CNN Model: cnnModel.txt
	b. For RNN Model: rnnModel.txt
	c. For HAN Model: hanModel.txt
7. It is required to have the following libraries installed:
	a. Keras
	b. NLTK
	c. Numpy 
	d. Pandas
	e. Sklearn
	f. MatPlotLib
8. libraries can be installed using the below command
	pip install <library name>
